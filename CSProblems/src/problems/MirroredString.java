/*Q8-MirroredString:
 *JJ the Giraffe found a new magic mirror!
 *
 *Instructions
 *JJ the Giraffe looks in his magic mirror to see things his way.  
 *While you canï¿½t print out text the way it would really look in a mirror, 
 *you can reflect the order of a string.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, 
 *is to create a method named reverse, which reverses a string.
 *
 *public static String reverse(String input) {...}
