/*Q13-Triangle:
 *JJ the Giraffe has moved on from cubes. He now likes Triangles. Help JJ play with his triangles.
 *Instructions
 * Implement a Triangle class with appropriate methods (all methods besides the constructor would return doubles):
 * 1 Constructor- that takes in the x and y of each coordinate point. The order should be (x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3) 
 * getSide1Length()  - returns the length between the first and second points
 * getSide2Length() – returns the length between the first and third points
 * getSide3Length() -  returns the length between the second and third points
 * getAngle1()- returns the measure of the angle formed by side1 and side2
 * getAngle2()- returns the measure of the angle formed by side2 and side3
 * getAngle3()- returns the measure of the angle formed by side1 and side3
 * getPerimeter()- returns the perimeter of the triangle
 * getArea() -  returns of the area of the triangle
 * HELPFUL INFORMATION: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2*b*c*COS(A)
 *     A
 *    /\
 * b /  \ c
 *  /____\
 * C  a   B
