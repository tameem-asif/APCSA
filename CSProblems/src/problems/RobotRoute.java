/*Q5-RobotRoute::
 *JJ the Giraffe decided to join Robotics one day! 
 *Yet wherever his robot goes, it keeps on going back to the same place!
 *Help him decide if his robot has ended up in the same place!
 *
 *Instructions
 *Initially, JJï¿½s Robot is at position (0, 0). 
 *Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot moves back to the original place.
 *
 *The move sequence is represented by a string. 
 *And each move is represent by a character. 
 *The valid robot moves are R (Right), L(Left), U (Up) and D (down). 
 *Each move is the same distance away. 
 *Given a string of moves, write a method samePlace that returns true or false representing whether 
 *the robot ends up in the same place it started. 
 *
 *public static boolean samePlace(String moves){...}
