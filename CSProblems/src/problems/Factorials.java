/*Q2-Factorials:
 *JJ the Giraffe canï¿½t stop yelling out his numbers with exclamation marks! 
 *Help him be more mathematically literate and teach him what factorials are!
 *
 *Instructions
 *A factorial is the product of a given positive integer (n) 
 *multiplied by all lesser positive integers and is represented as n! 
 *For example:
 * 
 *4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
 * 
 *Your task is to write a method (called factorial)  which will calculate any given factorial
 *
 *public static int factorial(int n){...}
 *
